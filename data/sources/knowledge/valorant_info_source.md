# VALORANT Tactical Strategy – Comprehensive Knowledge Compilation

## Fundamentals of Tactical FPS: *Information, Timing,* and *Positioning*

Modern tactical shooters like VALORANT and CS\:GO revolve around three core principles: **Information, Timing, and Positioning**. **Information** is what you know about the opponent’s whereabouts and intentions – the more you know (or deny the enemy), the better you can anticipate their next move. **Timing** is the cost in seconds of any action or rotation – how long it takes to move or execute a play from a given position. **Positioning** is your location on the map – which angles you hold, what cover you have, and what options that position gives you for the next step. All three operate together: *information informs where to position, and timing constrains what positions or plays are possible*. For example, if there are only 20 seconds left in a round and defenders know the spike and attackers are at A site, they also know attackers have no time to go elsewhere – defenders should rotate and stack A immediately, which almost guarantees a win as long as they arrive before the hit comes. In short, good decision-making in VALORANT means constantly weighing what you **know** (or suspect) about the enemy, how much **time** you have to act on that knowledge, and what **positions** will maximize your chances given the circumstances.

At high levels of play, both teams are constantly **jockeying for advantages in information and positioning**. Teams use a variety of strategic methods – such as controlling pace, setting up default formations, applying pressure, faking, and delaying – to manipulate the flow of info and timing in their favor. For instance, attackers may play a **default** (spread out formation) to collect info and deny the defense info. A well-structured default serves to (1) **condition the opponent’s expectations** (by establishing patterns in early rounds), (2) **gain map control** while denying info to the enemy, and (3) **force the defense to react** either by over-rotating or by making desperation info plays. All these outcomes make the defenders easier to read and exploit. By contrast, defenders may respond with **information plays** (like pushing for a flank or using recon abilities) or even **gamble rotations** – stacking a site without info – if they predict where the hit will come. Notably, doing something without solid info is called *“gambling”* a rotation or stack; it’s risky, but sometimes necessary if playing with a disadvantage (for example, in a 3v5 save round, grouping all three defenders on one site might be the only chance to win).

**Pacing** is another important concept: the overall speed of the attackers’ plays. A team that consistently rushes fast can **condition** the enemy to expect fast plays; suddenly slowing down the pace can catch defenders off guard, and vice versa. For example, if attackers have been rushing every round, defenders will likely use extra utility early and take defensive positions to brace for another rush. If the attackers then switch to a slow default that round, they might waste the defenders’ early utility and find openings once the defense starts wondering what’s happening. Good teams vary their pace to keep opponents guessing. They may also set **information traps**: e.g. deliberately play slow so that defenders get uneasy and push for info, then punish those pushes. A common pattern is defenders pushing the map **extremities** (like A Main or B Main on Ascent) when things go quiet; attackers who predict this can wait and catch the pushing players. If defenders don’t push at all, that *lack* of information eventually forces them into a gamble or a passive retake setup. In VALORANT, **information decays over time** – what the enemy saw 20 seconds ago may no longer be true. Attackers often **“cut noise”** (go quiet and hold) to let the defenders’ info go stale and lure them into mistakes or rotations off-site.

In summary, tactical FPS gameplay is a constant battle of **mind-games and trade-offs**: gaining info vs. concealing info, rotating vs. delaying, holding positions vs. pushing for a flank. VALORANT adds further layers to this with its agent abilities (utility), which we’ll cover next, but these core FPS principles remain at the heart of every decision.

## The Importance of Map Control (“Taking Space”)

A key tenet of VALORANT strategy is that the game is won by **controlling space, not by aim duels alone**. In fact, one can view VALORANT as a contest for *spatial control* or *area control* on the map. Teams that control larger, more critical areas of the map usually have the advantage, because they can maneuver freely and force the enemy into predictable, confined positions. In Japanese VALORANT communities this is sometimes called **“エリア理論”** (the area theory) – the idea that securing more area as a team leads to a favorable situation. By expanding the area your team safely controls, you **increase your options and make it easier to set up advantageous fights or supportive utility**. As a Japanese guide explains, an *“エリア”* is any space on the map that your team controls, and by widening that controlled area, your team can coordinate better and take fights on your own terms.

However, simply *saying* “take more map control to win” can sound abstract to beginners. In truth, **“taking space” is not an end goal in itself, but a means to other concrete advantages**. A tactical analysis on **note.com** points out that having more area is often *observed* in winning scenarios, but it’s not the area that directly kills the enemy – it’s what controlling that area allows you to do. For example, if your team has pushed and taken control of the enemy’s flank, the enemy is now **confined to a smaller zone** and can be attacked from multiple sides. The real causes of the enemy’s disadvantage are **being attacked from behind (unexpected angle)** and **being outnumbered in a crossfire** – both outcomes made possible *because* you controlled that flank space. In other words, map control yields **information (knowing areas are clear), better engagement angles (e.g. backstabbing or crossfires), and greater *options*** for your team’s next move. Those factors are what win rounds. So, while we often summarize it as “map control = win,” it’s important to understand *why* controlling an area helps you win: it denies the opponent freedom of movement and info, and it sets up favorable numbers or positional advantages for fights.

**Controlling space truly *dictates the round* and tilts the odds in your favor**. Imagine an attacking team that manages to sneak a lurker into the defender’s backlines – suddenly the defenders are “sandwiched” into a corner of the map. Even if no shots have been fired yet, the attackers have a major edge because the defenders’ positions are constrained and known. A concrete example: On Ascent, if defenders only hold A Main and A Lobby while attackers have someone lurked up mid and into Tree, the defenders are essentially trapped – this often results in attackers pinching the site from multiple sides and winning easily. One could say the defenders **“lost because they were squeezed into too little map control”**.

To achieve superior map control, teams must **coordinate to take territory** step by step. On attack, this could mean defaulting across the map, using utility to clear common spots, and methodically gaining ground (e.g. taking control of A Lobby or Mid before committing to a site). On defense, this might mean contesting key areas early (like fighting for mid, or pushing out an empty zone for information) so that the attackers cannot freely lurk or encircle you. A fundamental rule is **“nothing for free”** – if you concede one area, try to gain control *elsewhere*, so the enemy doesn’t get a free map advantage. For instance, if attackers seize A Long on Haven, defenders might respond by pushing up on C or Garage to reclaim space/information on another part of the map.

**Map control on Attack:** Good teams will rarely just five-man rush one choke point every round, because funneling all players through a single narrow path is predictable and easy for defenders to shut down. Instead, effective attacking involves **splitting** and **pressuring multiple areas** to stretch the defense. For example, on **Ascent**, mid control is often cited as crucial. If attackers only hit A through A Main, the defenders can concentrate all their utility and crosshairs on that choke. But if attackers gain mid control, they can threaten **Catwalk (Tree)** or **Market** and pinch a site from two directions. This forces defenders to worry about **multiple angles** and often results in an easier site take. One high-elo player explains: *“Ascent’s main chokes are tight and easy to hold, so you **NEED** to put pressure elsewhere (mid) to spread out the defenders.”* Another benefit of mid control: it allows **faster rotations**. Attackers can quickly rotate through mid to the other bombsite if one site is too fortified, effectively using mid as a highway to outmaneuver the defense. We see this in pro play as well – by taking mid, attackers keep defenders guessing where the final hit will come, because they can swiftly pivot to either site.

**Map control on Defense:** For defenders, controlling space means **denying the attackers free map access** and maintaining info on key areas. On many maps, if defenders give up important zones (for example, all of mid), they risk being flanked or split on. That’s why defenders often hold default positions that cover as many entry routes as possible. Using Ascent as an example again: typically one defender watches Mid Bottom (to contest any mid push) and another holds the Tree/Window area (watching Mid Top/Tiles), which allows the team to safely keep two players on B and one on A without fear of a lurk coming through mid unnoticed. If mid were completely open, an attacker could walk through and catch the B players from behind or cut off rotations. In short, **“control as much space as possible so you don’t need to worry about sneaky plays”**. Defenders can also **push for space** in certain situations – for instance, pushing out B Main on defense to get deep control and info. An aggressive defender (like a Chamber with a teleport setup) might take B Main control; if he finds no attackers there, he can even push up and **“rule out”** that avenue entirely, allowing his team to rotate more to A or mid. Of course, defensive aggression should be measured and often done with utility or agent abilities to be safe (flash-peeking, using a one-way smoke, etc.), because dying early while pushing is a fast way to lose a round.

**Every map** in Valorant has its own key areas whose control can decide rounds. On **Haven** (with three bomb sites), mid/Garage control is very important because it connects to all sites; if attackers take Garage/Window, they can pressure B or C and rapidly pivot, while defenders losing mid have a hard time rotating between sites. At the same time, Haven’s defense is stretched thin (you usually can’t hold all three sites and mid with full strength), so defenders often play retake on one site and focus on holding the *important* territory like Garage or A lobby. On **Split** (pre-rework), controlling mid vent/tower was critical for attackers to pinch sites, whereas on **Bind** (which lacks a traditional mid), control of the teleporters and connector areas served a similar purpose of rotation and pressure. **Knowing each map’s geography** – common choke points, flanking routes, and rotational pathways – is essential. Good players always ask: *“Which areas do we need to control for our plan, and which can we afford to give up?”* This textbook will later delve into **map-specific tips**, callouts, and strategies for each battlefield (Bind, Haven, Ascent, etc.), breaking down the unique aspects of controlling space on each.

## Agents’ Roles and Utility – VALORANT’s Unique Layer

What sets VALORANT apart from CS\:GO is the presence of **agents with unique abilities**. These abilities amplify the importance of strategy and team composition. Each agent typically fits one of several roles – **Duelist, Initiator, Controller,** or **Sentinel** – which hints at their job in controlling space and achieving objectives. Understanding these roles and how they combine is crucial for rational play:

* **Initiators** (e.g. Sova, Skye, Breach) excel at **gathering information and displacing defenders**, effectively *creating openings* for the team. They use recon or flashes to clear angles and force defenders off positions. In terms of space-taking: *“Initiators set up opportunities for teammates to attack – they initiate.”* For example, a Sova drone or Skye flash into an area pushes defenders back or reveals them, **creating space** that is less dangerous for the entry players.

* **Controllers** (e.g. Brimstone, Omen, Viper) use smokes and vision blockers to **define the boundaries of engagements**. By smoking off key sightlines, Controllers *carve out portions of the map* that are safe (or at least safer) for their team to occupy. In an execute, controllers cut off rotations and isolate the defenders’ lines of sight, **shrinking the effective area the enemy can control**. For instance, smoking Heaven and CT on a site take means defenders can’t peek until they push through smoke, allowing attackers to move in and plant. Controllers on defense also lock down areas with smokes (one-way smokes, vision denial) and stall pushes with utilities like Viper’s wall or Brim’s Incendiary. A common **game sense tip** for Controller players: always try to **save one smoke for the retake** when defending. If you’re playing defense and the attackers take a site, having that extra smoke to drop on the spike during the retake can hugely increase your team’s chance to defuse successfully.

* **Duelists** (e.g. Jett, Reyna, Phoenix, Yoru, Raze, Neon) are the **tip of the spear** – they are best equipped to **take the space** that initiators and controllers help create. Duelists typically have abilities that aid in aggressive plays or self-survival: *“If a Duelist is challenged when attempting to take space, a Reyna Dismiss or Jett Dash allows them to escape or reposition”*. In other words, duelists have *“get out of jail free”* cards that let them take early fights with a safety net. This makes them ideal entry fraggers: they go in first, **clear corners, and attempt to get the first kill**, knowing they have tools to avoid trade fire (Jett’s dash, Reyna’s dismiss/invulnerability, etc.). The goal for a duelist is to **convert the space made by allies into a foothold** on site – e.g. Jett dashing into a site after smokes to draw attention and create room for her teammates to follow. Other classes *can* entry if needed, but they lack those quick escape tools, so it’s riskier. (A **“hybrid” agent** like KAY/O can entry with his flash/ultimate, but since he has no escape, it requires more team support; *Chamber*, before his nerfs, was sometimes called a pseudo-duelist because his teleport let him play super aggro and still get away.)

* **Sentinels** (e.g. Sage, Cypher, Killjoy, Chamber) are primarily **defensive specialists** who **lock down areas and watch flanks**. Their utility (traps, walls, turrets) is designed to hold space *without the agent physically being there*. For example, Killjoy’s turret or Cypher’s tripwires can control a flank lane, allowing the team to focus elsewhere knowing their back is safe. This is a form of **space control through utility**: *“Killjoy holding an area (like A Lobby on Ascent) with her utility secures that space for her team’s use”*. Sentinels can also **delay enemy advances**, which is crucial on defense and post-plant. Sage’s wall or slow orb, Killjoy’s nano swarms, or Cypher’s cages all serve to **buy time and deny space to the enemy** during retakes or pushes. In fact, in post-plant situations, Sentinels and Controllers are the key players to **control the space around the planted spike** – using mollies, smokes, slows to *delay the defenders’ retake* as long as possible. The longer you delay, the less time the defenders have to clear angles and defuse, hence increasing the odds of winning the round. A well-known principle is that *stalling can be more valuable than frags* in post-plant: **“the goal of controlling space post-plant is to delay, delay, delay”**.

In planning any round, consider the **synergy of these roles**. A balanced team uses initiators/controllers to set the stage, duelists to capitalize and break into sites, and sentinels to anchor and cover flanks. For example, on an execute: a Skye flash clears the first angle (creating space), Omen smokes off two sightlines (defining space), and Jett dashes in to claim that space and seize an advanced position. Meanwhile, Killjoy’s alarm bot secures another part of the map from enemy flanks. Each piece of utility translates to **territorial control**: smokes carve out zones the enemy can’t see or contest, flashes push defenders off angles, mollies block off paths, and traps cover the zones you leave.

Another VALORANT-specific element is the **ultimate orb** and ultimate abilities. Unlike CS\:GO, VALORANT has an additional objective on the map: neutral orbs that charge your ult. Teams will sometimes contest or secure these orbs as part of their strategy (for instance, fighting for the A Lobby orb on Haven at round start, because getting a Sage res or a Killjoy lockdown sooner can be round-changing). This adds a layer of strategic decision-making – e.g., defenders might stack to guard an orb if they know the attackers really need an ult, or attackers might **bait a fight at an orb** to then hit the opposite site when the enemy rotates. **Ultimate economy** (who has their ult, and how close others are) is important info. A mid-rank tip is: *“Keep count of enemy orbs and ults; people in ranked are predictable with how they use ults”*. For example, if the enemy Raze is one orb away from Showstopper, you can predict she’ll play for an orb this round and then likely use the ult aggressively. Or if the enemy Jett has **\$5000** saved on defense, it’s **very likely she’ll buy an Operator**. Knowing that, your team should avoid dry-peeking common angles or should use utility to displace an Operator player. These kinds of predictions – based on economy and ult status – exemplify *“structural understanding”* beyond raw aim: you’re making rational choices (like not challenging a long sightline without utility) because you understand the underlying situation (e.g. the enemy probably has an Op watching it).

## Strategic Decision-Making: Win Conditions and “Playing to Your Win-Con”

One of the main goals of this textbook is to teach how to identify **win conditions** (勝ち筋) in a round and execute a plan to achieve them, rather than just running on autopilot or reflex. A *win condition* means the specific scenario or advantage your team can realistically aim for that would likely secure the round. This depends heavily on the current **situation** – which we define in terms of area control, team statuses, and available resources (utility/ults). In practical terms, “playing to win conditions” involves constantly evaluating questions like: *“Do we win this round by executing fast before the enemy rotates? Or by play slow for picks? Do we need to play retake on B and stack A? Is our win condition a post-plant situation where we play numbers advantage and delay?”* The answer will change round to round, but a player with good game sense will **consciously identify how their team can win, given the circumstances, and then take logical actions toward that goal**.

For example, consider you are in a **5v4 advantage** as attackers after getting an early pick. A clear win condition now is *“trade one-for-one and play numbers to close out”*. The rational play is to **avoid giving the enemy any isolated 1v1s** that let them equalize. That means regrouping, trading kills, and not over-peeking solo. In other words, when you have a *man advantage*, **don’t push or take low-percentage fights alone; play trade-able with teammates**. A common rule: *“When in man advantage, you want to always be trade-able – even if that means giving up some space to fall back together.”* It’s better to let the enemy have a bit of map room than to hold alone and die with no trade. Conversely, if you’re in a **numbers disadvantage** (say 3v5 or 1v2), your win condition might be *“create a surprise and get a pick to even the odds”*. Thus, the textbook would encourage in a **disadvantage** that you **seek a kill or a power position proactively** – for instance, a **1v2 clutch** often requires isolating a 1v1 fight before the two enemies can trade you. It is usually *incorrect* to play overly passive when down in numbers; one pro tip from a Radiant player: *“in a post-plant 1v2, don’t just hide – play a little aggressive to get an isolated gunfight and catch one enemy by surprise”*. Even if you lose that duel, it was likely the right move, because simply hiding would allow the two enemies to overwhelm you together anyway. Many low-rank players make the mistake of **freezing up when at a disadvantage**, but the rational play is often to **take an informed risk** (push where they won’t expect, or make a play *before* the enemy can group up). The key is doing so intelligently – use any info you have to pick the best gamble. As an example, if you know one enemy is isolated from his teammate, you might push that one; but if they’re together, you might instead reposition for a crossfire or play an off-angle to get one kill and reposition.

Let’s connect this to earlier topics: A *“structured understanding”* of the game means you analyze the **situation (状況)** in terms of those fundamental elements – areas controlled, information known, opponent’s likely decisions, and resources. In VALORANT, we define a **situation** not just by the kill count or HP left, but by a combination of spatial and informational factors:

* **Which areas of the map does each team control right now?** (Who has “主導権” in each zone?)
* **Where might enemies be lurking that we *don’t* know about?** (What are the unknowns or potential flanks?)
* **What does the enemy know about *our* positions or intentions?** (Have we been spotted or are we concealed?)
* **What key abilities or ultimates are still available on each side?** (For instance, does the enemy Sage have res, or do we have a Killjoy ult for post-plant?)

These factors define the state of the round. A player with good game sense continuously updates this mental model. **Top players’ actions are always “based on a win condition” derived from this situational awareness:** e.g., *“We have Killjoy lockdown and number advantage? Our win condition is to play slow, use KJ ult to force them off site and secure a free plant.”* Or *“Our Jett died and we lost B main control on attack? Our win condition might be to *regain map control elsewhere* (maybe take mid) and look for a pick before committing.”* There is always a reason behind the move – and usually that reason can be explained in terms of securing space, denying enemy info, or exploiting a timing window.

One way to practically improve this skill is to **think backwards from the objective** – what do we need to achieve to win the round, and what steps lead to that? This text calls it *“逆算思考”*: victory condition → win route → actions. For example, on defense pistol 3v3 retake: our win condition might be *“stick a defuse”* because pistols are chaotic. So the route is to get a half-defuse to draw peeks, and the actions are smoke the spike and double swing when they shoot the defuser. Another scenario: as attackers in a 5v5 with 30 seconds left and little map control, the win condition could be *“explode onto one site together and get a numbers trade in our favor”*. Thus the plan is to group and execute with whatever utility is left, rather than slowly defaulting (since time is low). In short, **don’t play on autopilot** – always identify how you intend to win the round (or the next duel) and align your actions to that plan.

## Team Coordination and Communication

VALORANT is a team game, and many “rational” plays assume teamwork. Even a perfect strategy fails if teammates do not follow up or trade properly. Therefore, developing a strategic mindset also involves **communication** and understanding how to work with teammates’ decisions. Here are some key teamwork concepts and how knowledge/theory supports them:

* **Trading and Spacing:** Trading means if your teammate dies, you are immediately there to get the refrag. This requires proper spacing (not too far apart). Earlier we noted, in man-advantage situations you should play trade-able and not isolate yourself. A practical tip is maintaining a distance of about a few meters where you can swing immediately on the enemy who killed your ally. One user succinctly put it: *“You want to always be trade-able – this means giving up space if you don’t have a teammate to help you hold it.”* Good trading is facilitated by watching the **minimap** and tracking teammates’ positions. In fact, one of the **biggest tips for improving game sense and teamwork** is: **“LOOK AT YOUR MINIMAP whenever you’re not actively shooting someone.”** The minimap shows you what your teammates see, and can reveal gaps in your coverage. For example, if you notice on the map that no one is watching flank, you might fall back to cover it or alert your team. Or if you’re second in entry behind your duelist, staring at the minimap can actually give you a heads-up on where enemies are: if your duelist spots an enemy even for a split second, that enemy’s location *pings* on the minimap, so you can pre-aim and swing to trade before you physically see them on your screen. Top players constantly use the minimap to synchronize their plays – it’s practically a *wallhack* of shared info that many beginners underutilize. Efficient trading also means **clearing angles systematically** (so you don’t both get caught by one unseen enemy) and maintaining **spacing** (too close and a single spray could kill both, too far and you can’t trade).

* **Crossfires and Double Peeks:** A crossfire is a setup where two players cover the same area from different angles, making it almost impossible for an enemy to push without facing one of you. Setting these up relies on map control and communication (“I’ll hold if you swing on contact”). A **double peek** is when two players swing an angle at the same time, overwhelming a single defender. These tactics embody the idea of using **numbers advantage properly**. Instead of isolated 1v1 duels, you force the enemy into 1v2s. An example call might be “double peek heaven on three...1-2-3!” to trade out a heaven player together. From the strategic viewpoint, you are leveraging your **manpower and timing** to ensure a favorable outcome (even the best aimer cannot reliably kill two people peeking from different spots).

* **Defaulting and Mid-round Calls:** Earlier we discussed defaulting (spreading out, controlling map). This requires everyone to understand their role: usually each player (or pair) takes responsibility for a portion of the map (e.g. “you hold B lurk, we work A control”). Communication is critical if someone spots the enemy or hears rotations, so the team can decide where to hit. A common **mid-round communication** might be: *“There’s 3 on A (seen by our initiator’s info), let’s rotate off and hit B – lurker, hold their rotate in mid.”* For instance, *“We’re going to rotate out since there’s too much utility/3 players here; can you walk up mid and hold their rotation?”*. In shorthand, someone might say “3 A, let’s rotate, lurk up mid now.” This kind of call is directly informed by game sense: you recognized the **enemy stack/timing** and chose the win condition of going where they’re weak, instructing the lurker to seize the space you need (mid) and catch the rotating enemies. The lurker and the team must be in sync on the timing – e.g. *“We’re about to entry B, lurker start pushing tree in 5 seconds.”* Teams that practice this will often say things like *“hold for a moment, let our lurk work”* or *“make noise on A to draw rotates, then hit C”.* All of these are strategic mid-round adjustments that come from understanding how the enemy is positioned and reacting.

* **Utility Coordination:** VALORANT is unique in how much value you can get from combining abilities. A well-coordinated execute (“setplay”) involves timing utility together: e.g. breach stun + raze grenade + double peek. According to terminology, a **“セットプレイ”** is *“a pre-planned strat where multiple abilities are used in sync to attack or retake a site.”* If your team knows a particular combo (like Fade seize + Raze nade), communicating to use it at the right time can win rounds decisively. Similarly, on defense a retake setup might require someone to say *“wait for my flash then swing”* or *“after Sage wall, Sova ult the planter”*. The more everyone understands the logic (like *why* you want to use abilities in a certain order), the smoother these plans execute.

* **Adapting to Teammates:** In solo queue ranked, you often can’t rely on perfect teamwork. However, a strategically aware player will **adapt their play to what teammates are doing (or not doing)**. For example, if you notice your team isn’t defaulting at all (maybe they just rush sites), you might take it upon yourself to lurk or watch flanks to cover that strategic gap. Or if your duelists keep dying without trading, you might play closer to trade them or suggest a slower approach. Part of being a rational player is not only making good personal decisions, but also **influencing your team** with calls or by filling necessary roles. Even if you’re not the IGL, simple calls like *“Let’s not peek, we have numbers”* (to stop a throw), or *“Can someone come with me to trade?”* can inject logic into chaotic ranked games.

Finally, **post-round reviews** and communication help build structural understanding. A great habit is to ask after a round, *“Why did we lose that? What went wrong?”* For instance, *“We lost that 2v2 because we peeked separately instead of together – next time let’s trade.”* Or *“They flanked us because we left mid open – we need a trip or someone holding next time.”* Good players **verbalize the reasons** for round outcomes. This reflective practice turns each loss into a learning opportunity and cements the principles discussed: you start seeing that many lost rounds trace back to **structural issues** like lack of info, poor spacing, or giving up important map control, rather than just missed shots. Over time, you’ll internalize these lessons and instinctively play more logically.

## Common Mistakes of Intermediate Players (and How to Fix Them)

Let’s revisit the typical issues seen at the beginner/intermediate level (Bronze to Gold), as listed in the introduction, and analyze them with the concepts we’ve gathered:

* **“I don’t know *where* I should be going.”**
  This usually stems from not understanding map control and default responsibilities. Every round, each player should have an idea of what area they are taking or holding. If you spawn and feel lost, start by considering: *Where is my team going? What lanes are important on this map?* For example, on attack in Haven, if your team all goes A, who is watching mid or C push? Maybe you need to hold an angle for a bit. On defense, if you’re a sentinel on Split, should you hold mid or anchor site? Knowing the **high-value areas** comes from map knowledge (as we’ll provide in map chapters). A rational approach is to **ensure all critical map zones are accounted for** either by you or a teammate’s utility. If something is unwatched, that’s a problem to solve. Good practice is learning default setups: e.g., on **Ascent attack**, typically 2 players work A main, 2 work B main, 1 lurks mid – these defaults are common for a reason, they cover the map. If you find yourself wandering, communicate with teammates: *“I’ll hold mid lurk while you guys work A.”* By proactively taking a role in the default, you always have a meaningful “where” to be. As you gain experience, you’ll also learn to adjust positions mid-round (rotating through spawn to help another site, pushing an empty flank for info, etc.). The guiding principle: **be somewhere that contributes to the win condition** – either helping execute the current plan or controlling an important section of the map. Don’t stand idle in a safe spot doing nothing; even holding an angle to cut off rotations is valuable if it aligns with the team’s goal.

* **“I don’t know *why* we should push now (or not).”**
  This is about understanding **timing** and win conditions. Many players struggle with deciding between playing slow or fast, passive or aggressive. The “why now?” comes down to evaluating advantages: Did you get a pick? Did the enemy use key utility? Is the spike planted and the clock ticking? These situational cues dictate the correct pace. For instance, *why* you should **push in a 4v5** (disadvantage) might be because doing nothing means the enemy will just group and squeeze you – you need to regain initiative (we discussed pushing for an equalizer kill as a win condition). Conversely, *why* you **should NOT push in a 5v4** is because the only way to lose the advantage is by giving the enemy 1v1 fights to catch up. Another common scenario: **post-plant as attackers**, *why* should you sometimes **push out and take fights** instead of hiding on site? If it’s a 1v3 post-plant, hiding will get you triple peeked, so your best chance is surprise an isolated player (again, turning it into 1v2) – that’s the *why*. On the other hand, in a **3v1 post-plant**, you should **not** peek the last enemy alone (ego peeking); the *why* is that you have numbers and the spike planted, so the only way to lose is to give 1v1s. By thinking in terms of *“what increases our win % right now?”* you’ll answer the why. Sometimes it’s correct to **wait** (e.g. waiting 5 more seconds for your flanking teammate to get in position before you burst onto site – the why is to hit together from two sides). Other times it’s correct to **go** (e.g. you hear two enemies rotating off B, *now* is the moment to explode onto the weakened site *before* they come back). This is the essence of timing and reading the situation. The textbook will provide many scenario-based drills to practice this sense – for example, recognizing when the **enemy is reloading or stunned** (push now), or when **you have no info on the other site** (don’t rotate too early). Over time, you’ll internalize triggers for action vs. patience. In short, always justify a push or a pause by something concrete: *“We push now because X”* (they used both sentry abilities, or only one is on site, or clock is low), or *“We wait because Y”* (our lurker is not in place yet, or they might make a mistake if we hold, etc.).

* **“I keep losing gunfights, but I don’t know how to improve.”**
  Mechanical aim is certainly important, but many aim duels are won before shots are even fired – through better positioning, angle selection, and utility usage. If you struggle with pure aim, a strategic approach can mitigate it: **take fights on your terms**. This means using cover, jiggle-peeking for info, and prefiring common spots. Also, make sure your **crosshair placement and peeking technique** are solid (this is basic FPS mechanics – always pre-aim head height where an enemy might be). Beyond that, understand **angle advantage**: a concept where the player farther from a corner sees the opponent first. This means wide-swinging can actually be advantageous to surprise a holding opponent, if done correctly. The textbook will cover peeking methods (shoulder peeks, jiggle, wide swing) and when to use each. Another factor is **utility** – if you’re losing 1v1 aim duels, start turning them into 2v1 or using abilities to tilt the odds. Flash before you peek, or double peek with a teammate, or use a drone to spot the enemy. If you consistently dry-peek an Operator in long range and die, the strategic fix is clear: **“Don’t dry peek an Op”**; instead **hold** an off-angle or use utility to force the op off. Oftentimes, what seems like an aim issue is actually a **positioning issue** – for example, you’re pushing alone into a crossfire. No amount of raw aim will save you there. The rational improvement is to not enter unfavorable fights to begin with. Additionally, analyze *why* you lost a particular fight: Did you peek too predictably? Were you caught running with your knife? Did the enemy swing while you weren’t ready? Many of these have strategic solutions (improve movement timing, clear with utility, etc.). One *game sense* tip intimately tied to winning fights is checking the **minimap for info before engaging** – e.g. if your teammate is watching an angle, you can focus your crosshair elsewhere, or if an enemy was last seen in a certain area you pre-aim that. Better information leads to better readiness in duels. In summary: improving aim itself requires practice (deathmatch, drills), but **improving your engagements** requires strategic insight – take only necessary fights, take *favored* fights (multiple teammates vs one enemy, or when your ability gives you an edge), and avoid the enemy’s strengths (e.g. don’t fight long-range against an Op or Marshal with a Spectre; instead, maybe flank or wait out the angle).

* **“I can’t coordinate with my teammates, and I’m not sure what’s going wrong.”**
  This can be multifaceted: it might be timing (you peek before your teammate is ready to trade), or spacing (you’re too far to help), or target selection (both of you watch the same angle while an enemy flanks from another). The solution starts with the **common language of strategy**. Make sure you and teammates agree on a plan via quick calls: e.g. *“let’s contact walk A”*, *“play retake B”*, *“fight mid control”*. If everyone knows the plan, coordination improves. Use pings or “I’m going” voice lines to synchronize pushes (“3, 2, 1, swing”). Also, understand **complementary positioning**: if your ally is holding an angle, maybe you should hold a different one that covers their weakness. For instance, if two of you are defending a site, do not stand in the same corner watching the same thing; set up a crossfire or at least different elevations. If coordination fails in post-plant (like peeking at different times), try to identify why – maybe one person thought time was lower. The fix could be explicitly saying *“Don’t peek, play time,”* or *“Tap the bomb and swing together.”* Essentially, someone needs to take the initiative to *call the play*. If your team isn’t naturally coordinating, be that person who says what to do in simple terms. Over time, as you and others practice teamplay exercises (like 2vX scenarios, execute drills), you’ll develop a sense of what each teammate is likely to do and how to fit your play around it. For example, if you know your Reyna loves to peek early, be ready to trade her; if you know your Sage anchors site, maybe you can be the fast rotate. Even without verbal comms, you can coordinate implicitly by understanding each role’s typical play. Another common issue is **utility misuse** between teammates – e.g. one flashes but the other wasn’t ready to peek. Solve this by establishing protocols (a simple “flashing now!” can cue your teammate). The textbook will introduce a unified framework for team scenarios, so even with random teammates, you can identify the logical team play and either execute it or suggest it. Remember, if something felt uncoordinated, break it down: *“We both pushed different sites alone – next time, let's group.”* or *“We peeked before the smoke bloomed – we need to wait half a second longer.”* These are structural fixes. Coordination is basically about **timing and spacing together**, which as we covered are themselves things you can practice and reason about.

By addressing these common mistakes through the lens of strategy and structure, players move from reacting blindly to understanding the *principles* behind each play. The goal is that you can **explain to yourself or others *why* a round was lost or won** in clear terms (e.g. “We didn’t clear Hookah and got flanked” or “We wasted too much time so we had to spike rush and died to crossfire”). This analytical ability is exactly what turns a “just okay” player into a rapidly improving one. Every mistake becomes data for improvement rather than a mystery.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

In this compilation, we gathered a broad range of knowledge – from high-level tactical theory, to concrete tips and rules of thumb from community experts, to definitions of VALORANT-specific terms and roles. We’ve seen that **VALORANT is a game of decisions and trade-offs grounded in information, space, and timing**. Mechanical skill and reflexes matter, but what truly separates a smart player is the ability to **analyze the situation rationally and act accordingly**. By studying why certain strategies work – for example, why controlling Mid on Ascent is so powerful (it splits the defense), or why a team playing retake should still contest map control elsewhere (“nothing for free”) – you arm yourself with reasoning that can be applied in-game at a moment’s notice.

Going forward, the *VALORANT Tactical Textbook* will build on this foundation. Each chapter will dive deeper into specific topics: controlling and retaking **areas** (with map-by-map breakdowns), executing **set plays** with utility, effective **communication and mid-round calling**, **post-plant philosophies**, and more. We will use a consistent format of **theory → examples → diagrams → exercises → common mistakes (NG plays)** to reinforce learning. For instance, after explaining a concept like “playing the off-angle,” we’ll show an example round, illustrate it on a map, then provide an exercise scenario for you to think through, and highlight a few “wrong” plays people often try so you can avoid them.

Always remember the overarching theme: **Victory in VALORANT comes from rational play – finding the optimal path to win and executing it**. This means no more “just because” pushes or “I guess I’ll lurk here” indecision. By absorbing the knowledge collected (from pros, coaches, and community veterans) and through your own practice, you’ll be able to approach each round with a clear mind and a plan. When you make a move, you’ll know *why* you’re doing it and what you expect to gain. And when something unexpected happens (because Valorant is a game of imperfect information, after all), you’ll have the tools to adapt on the fly – whether it’s changing the pace, re-taking space elsewhere, or rethinking the win condition.

In conclusion, this compendium of VALORANT tactics and theory is not meant to be read once and set aside. It’s a **reference and training tool**. Revisit these concepts regularly, reflect on your games, and even discuss them with teammates. Over time, what is now an explicit thought process (“okay, we lost A Main control, so our new plan is...”) will become second nature. The game will “slow down” for you in the moment, as you instantly recognize patterns and optimal responses. Our hope is that your VALORANT experience becomes not only more successful but more rewarding intellectually – as you realize the depth behind each round and take pride in outsmarting opponents, not just outgunning them.

**Sources:** The information here has been gathered from a variety of up-to-date resources: community discussions by high-level players (for practical tips and common rules), professional guides and articles (for structured approaches to map control and defaults), and Japanese Valorant strategy analyses (to ensure concepts are conveyed in terms familiar to the JP community). All specific quotes and data points are cited so you can reference the original context as needed. This comprehensive approach ensures *nothing important has been left out* – we’ve included **every piece of relevant insight** discovered in the research phase, rather than only a pre-digested summary. The aim is to provide a rich knowledge base that you (and the AI tools in use) can draw upon for deeper analysis, without any loss of detail or nuance from the original sources. Happy learning, and see you in the next chapter where we apply these principles to real in-game scenarios!
